Title: Predicting and Identifying Determinant Factors for Adverse Birth Outcomes in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Data-Driven Investigation with Advanced Machine Learning Techniques


This study utilized secondary data from the most recent Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted in the following 26 Sub-Saharan Africa countries: Ethiopia (2016), Kenya (2022), Uganda (2016), Tanzania (2022), Burundi (2017), Rwanda (2015), Madagascar (2021), Mozambique (2015), Zimbabwe (2015), Zambia (2018), Malawi (2016), and so on (Refer the whole document after publication).


In this study, the primary measure utilized was adverse birth outcomes, which were determined based on the availability of relevant items in the DHS (Demographic and Health Survey). These outcomes encompassed the occurrence of one or more specific conditions during recent pregnancies, such as low birth weight, macrosomia, preterm birth, or stillbirth. The researchers combined these factors, including low birth weight, macrosomia, stillbirth, and gestational age of less than 37 weeks, to create a single variable. This variable was assigned a value of 1 if any adverse birth outcomes were reported, indicating the presence of an adverse birth outcome, and a value of 0 if none of these outcomes were reported.
